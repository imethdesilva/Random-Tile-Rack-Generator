This is a program that can be used by Scrabble Players as a coaching tool to develop practice in Rack Balancing concepts. It's still work in progress. I am hoping to implement features similar to Zyzzyva and Quackle which displays the equity and valuation of the particular move that a player decides to go ahead with.
